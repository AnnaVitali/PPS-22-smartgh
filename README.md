# PPS-22-smartgh

Project for `Paradigmi di Programmazione e Sviluppo` course of `University of Bologna` (A.Y. 2021/2022).

`PPS-22-smartgh` application aims to simulate the management of an intelligent greenhouse, able to interact with the environment in which it is located through sensors that detect relevant parameters for plant growth and receive updates on external environmental conditions.

Once the application is started, it will be possible to set the location of the greenhouse and the plants to cultivate inside it.

The user will be able to view the evolution of the state of the greenhouse during the day and will be able to interact with the individual areas, carrying out routine maintenance actions or guided corrective actions if the sensors detect an alarm situation.
